    <h2>Why Eat Healthy?</h2>
    <p>
      Healthy Meals was founded in 2021 with a simple idea: that nutritious food should be easy, affordable, and full of flavor. It all started when I was juggling a busy life—work, kids, stress—and my health was taking the hit. I constantly felt tired, sluggish, and disconnected from what I was eating. Fast food was quick, but it left me drained. I knew something had to change.
    </p>

    <p>
      That’s when I started researching balanced meals, whole ingredients, and meal prep strategies. I wasn’t a chef—just a regular person trying to feel better. Slowly, I began creating simple recipes using fresh ingredients, healthy proteins, and colorful vegetables. Within weeks, my energy improved, I felt more focused, and I actually looked forward to cooking.
    </p>

    <p>
      Friends and family started asking me for recipes, so I built this website as a way to share everything I learned. The meals here aren’t fancy—they’re real. They’re built to fit busy lives and nourish real bodies. Whether you're looking to boost your energy, lose weight, eat cleaner, or just feel better overall, you're in the right place.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since launching, Healthy Meals has helped dozens of people build better habits without giving up the joy of eating. It’s not about dieting—it’s about living well.
